# Model Train Controller (Arduino)
Takes inputs from controls like those found on a railway locomotive and simulates train inertia. Outputs a PWM signal for a DC motor driver to control a model railway.

Written for Arduino Uno using Arduino 1.8.5. It also requires the MsTimer2 library found [here](https://playground.arduino.cc/Main/MsTimer2).

For a brief explanation of the algorithm used, check out [this C# software demo](https://github.com/timjbro/Model-Train-Controller-Demo) and [this video](https://youtu.be/kx5FY7DlOaA).
